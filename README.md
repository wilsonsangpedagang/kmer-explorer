Overview

The Genome Analysis Toolkit is a Python-based application designed for analyzing DNA sequences. It offers functionalities to compute reverse complements of k-mer patterns, count occurrences of k-mer patterns in a given genome, and find the most frequent k-mer patterns. This toolkit is useful for researchers and bioinformaticians working with genomic data.

Features

Compute Reverse Complement: Input a k-mer pattern and get its reverse complement.
Count k-mer Patterns: Count how many times a specified k-mer pattern (or its complement) appears in a given genome.
Find Most Frequent k-mer Patterns: Identify the k-mer patterns that appear most frequently in the genome.
Requirements

Python 3.x
No additional libraries required
Usage

Error Handling

If the specified genome file is not found, the program will notify the user and prompt for the file name again.
